Our goal is determination of minimal set of descriptive metrics which will fully define the state of the system. The idea is grouping of performance metrics with similar behaviour and selection of most interesting representatives from each group.  We suggest K-medoids clustering algorithm  for finding closely correlated group of metrics.
